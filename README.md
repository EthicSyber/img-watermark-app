# IMG WATERMARK APP


The Image Watermark App is an application that will take any type of image and output a copy with the watermark you choose. Currently this project is using PIL (Python Image library) and Tkinter. The PIL library handles the image process in the background and Tkinter helped with building the User Interface. You'll notice that the application isn't showing the preview on the canvas background of the app instead it will only show a temp file when using watermark after selecting a file. 

The above was update. Later on I will update the photos below to show a file preview and a save button added. The save currently does not handle the file not being there is yes is selected. I will work on this at a future time.
